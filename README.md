Specvizitor is a Python GUI application for a visual inspection of astronomical spectroscopic data. The main goal is to provide a flexible tool for classifying **large** and **homogeneous** spectroscopic samples of galaxies, which is a typical case for blind spectroscopic surveys, including JWST WFSS surveys. Originally developed for the JWST Cycle 1 program [FRESCO](https://jwst-fresco.astro.unige.ch), this software can be easily adapted for a variety of spectroscopic data sets represented in standard data formats used in the astronomy community (FITS, ASCII, etc.).

For installation instructions, see the [online documentation](https://ivkram.github.io/specvizitor/).
