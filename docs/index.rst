Specvizitor is a graphical desktop application for a visual inspection of astronomical spectroscopic data. Its main features are:

#. Support for data formats widely used in the astronomy community (FITS, ASCII, TIFF, ...).
#. Interactive data widgets: scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in, move the sliders to change the redshift and smooth the data, interact with the colorbar to adjust its range, and more.
#. A dedicated widget for classifying objects and writing comments.
#. Customizable user interface: create widgets tailored to your dataset and adapt the viewer's layout for a better visual experience.
#. Other useful features including quick search, subset inspection, and support for creating cutouts from astronomical images on the fly.
